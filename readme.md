Hi!
Welcome to my project where I intend to identify suspicious activity in video streams.

The intention is to detect suspicious activity eg people carrying weapons in their hands say knife or gun, or people running away in malls, etc.

I have made this project as a learning experience and there are many things that we can improve. Please feel free to share your feedback and suggestions on how we can make it even better.
